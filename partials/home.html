        <h2>Article 1</h2>
        <h3> The Value of Money </h3>
        <p> Before we can talk about the value of money, we must first define money. What is money? According to Investopia, money is any item or medium of exchange that is accepted by people for the payment of goods and services. <br> The value of money is determined by the demand or need for it. The value for money can be determined by what good or service an indivdual will exchange it for. when talking about the value of money it is impossible to not mention terms like inflation and deflation. Inflation is the period when the value of money decreases over time and deflation is when the value of money increases over time. To read more on the value of money, read the article by Kimberly Amadeo titled "What Gives Money Its Value?".</p>

            <h3> GMO Foods </h3>
            <p> GMO stands for genetically modified organism, which is also known as Genetically modified foods. These are foods "produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using various methods of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits when compared to previous methods, such as selective breeding and mutation breeding." (Wikipedia). </p>

            <h2>Article 3</h2>
            <h3> The View of World in 2100 </h3>
            <p>Personally, i think it is hard to accurately predict how the world will be in 2100, just like how no one 10 years ago could predict that the world would be on shutdown in 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic. However we can make estimates or imagine using things happening in the present about how the future will look like. With the way technology continues to grow everyday, we can agree that in 2100, technology will be a lot more advanced. According to the an article "What will the world be like in 2100" by Iker Urrutia, there might even be a new world order, the US might no longer be the most powerful country in the world, it might also not even be China. It is really hard to tell exactly how the world will be but i am sure that the changes will surprise me and you.</p>
